# ReflectI

ReflectI is a privacy-focused, offline-first mental health journaling app designed to help users nurture self-awareness, track mood, and engage with gentle CBT-inspired prompts — all without needing an account or internet connection.

## Key Aims

- **Privacy First:**
    No accounts, no cloud storage — all data stays encrypted locally on the user’s device. Users fully control their personal journal and mood data.

- **Offline-First:**
    The app works completely without internet, so journaling and mood tracking are always accessible and secure.

- **Guided Reflection:**
    Daily CBT-style prompts and exercises encourage healthy mental habits and deeper self-awareness.

- **Mood Tracking:**
    Easy logging of moods and emotions to help users observe patterns and progress over time.

- **Voice Journaling (Optional):**
    Users can record voice entries for a hands-free, natural journaling experience.

- **Cross-Platform:**
    Desktop-first (Windows, macOS, Linux) with plans to expand to mobile platforms, keeping experiences consistent but separate for security.

- **User-Centered Design:**
    Intuitive, calming UI with accessibility and customization in mind, inspired by Solarpunk aesthetics.
